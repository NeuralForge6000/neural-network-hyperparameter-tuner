Technical Summary
You built a full-stack machine learning application consisting of:

#Backend
From-scratch neural network implementation in NumPy (forward/backward propagation, gradient descent)
Flask REST API with real-time training endpoints and background threading
Intelligent analysis engine that evaluates training metrics and generates optimization recommendations

#Frontend
Interactive web interface with real-time parameter controls and live training visualization
Matrix-themed UI with canvas animations and responsive design
Dynamic recommendation system with automatic parameter adjustment capabilities
Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no frameworks, yet delivers enterprise-level functionality

#Integration
Real-time communication between frontend and backend via HTTP polling
Automated hyperparameter optimization through AI-generated suggestions
Complete MLOps workflow from data loading to model training to performance analysis

Result: A production-ready educational ML platform that demonstrates neural network fundamentals while providing practical optimization tools - all implemented from scratch without external ML frameworks or frontend libraries.
